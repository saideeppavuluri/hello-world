# hello-world
Just checking the working of git hub.

I am Saideep Pavuluri and working with pore scale modeling. I started working with channel flows and will later extend my research towards porous media and oil recovery, CCS scopes.

I am working with interFoam as of now which is a solver for the standard navier- stokes equation.
